## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

1. This was a remake of an earlier project done in Vanilla Javascript. I got to resolve a "game over and restart" bug unsolved from past version.  
2. I got to better understand prop drilling and useEffect in Next.js.  
3. And i got to perfect my Media Queries setup skills.   

### Continued development

More Next.js projects. GraphQL projects too in the longer term.
